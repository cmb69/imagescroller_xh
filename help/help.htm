<p>
    Imagescroller_XH facilitates displaying a scrolling slideshow of images
    (optionally with links and with a description). It has no back-end
    functionality to manage the galleries. Instead the images have to be
    uploaded via FTP or the CMSimple file manager. Additional information for
    the links and the description has to be entered manually in a special text
    file.

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    To display an image scroller with all all images in the folder
    <code>images/my_gallery/</code> alphabetically sorted, insert in a page:
</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:imagescroller('./images/my_gallery');}}}</pre>
<p>
    To display the image scroller on all pages, you have to set the autoload
    configuration option to <code>1</code>, and to insert in the template:
</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo imagescroller('./images/my_gallery');?&gt;</pre>
<p>
    If you want to link the images or add titles or descriptions, you have to
    create an info file. This is best placed in the same folder as the images,
    and can have any name you prefer. To edit this file you can use any text
    editor you prefer, but it is important that the file is UTF-8 encoded.
</p>
<p>
    The file contains a record for each image you want to show; records are
    seperated by a single empty line. The records have the following fields:
    filename, URL, title, description; the fields of the record are written on
    separate lines and have to be in this order, but you can omit trailing
    fields, e.g. if you don't need a title and description, just write the
    filename and the URL. If you want to skip a field, just enter a single space
    in its line. The filename of the image has to be relative to the info file;
    the URL can be relative to the current CMSimple (sub-)site or absolute. An
    example info file looks like:
</p>
<pre>

My favorite website ;)
</pre>
<p>
    To display the image scroller just call imagescroller with the path to the
    info file, e.g.
</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:imagescroller('./images/my_gallery/info.txt');}}}</pre>
<p>
    Note that all images should have the same size (i.e. dimensions). Otherwise
    they will be resized to the size of the first image in the gallery, and in
    the back-end a warning will be shown.
</p>
</section>

<section id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
    Though it's possible to show more than one image scroller on a single page,
    the controls work simultaneous for all. E.g. if you pause one scroller, all
    others will be paused too.
